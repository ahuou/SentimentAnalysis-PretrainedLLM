This folder contains baselines to measure the performance of our own model to other methods

- **baselinesFinal.ipynb**: Evaluates model performance using various ML classification methods and provides reports.
- **baselinesRoberta.py**: Sets up and runs the Tweet pretrained model Roberta

## PreRunRoberta

Since the evaluation of the dataset with the model takes a bit of time, in this folders are some 
special instanciations of the 2 modules discussed above. These files are mostly to be used to 
get the accuracies/graphs, it is not recommended to edit them in the slightest
